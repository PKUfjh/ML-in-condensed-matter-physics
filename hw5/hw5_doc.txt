Restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) for MNIST.

Please run the program (hw5-rbm.py)*, tune parameters and plot the figures. The task of generating handwritten digits is very difficult and does not require good results.

Submit the runtime outputs and the best figures on the course.pku.edu.cn.

Note that you need to submit a total of 8 figures, the example figures are shown below.

*Since some students reported that TensorFlow is not compatible with Apple M1, this time the code is written in PyTorch. For the installation of PyTorch, please refer to https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ .
